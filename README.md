## Compilation/Interpretation Guidelines

This project supports pyproject.toml file and was packaged using uv.

You can check how to install uv in your system at [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/]()

Once done, simply run uv sync to install all the needed packages. uv downloads python if needed, creates a venv, and installs packages. Then simply run main.ipynb file.
